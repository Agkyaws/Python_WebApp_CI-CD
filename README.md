Python Web Application Deployment with Kubernetes and Jenkins
Overview
This project demonstrates the automated deployment of a Python web application using Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins CI/CD. It also includes monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for Jenkins servers and the Kubernetes cluster.

Features
Flask Web Application: A simple web app built with Flask.
MySQL Integration: The application connects to a MySQL database.
Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
Kubernetes: Manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of the application.
Jenkins CI/CD: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
Prometheus: Collects metrics from Jenkins and Kubernetes.
Grafana: Visualizes metrics for real-time monitoring and alerting.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker
Kubernetes
Jenkins
Prometheus
Grafana
Setup
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Configure Jenkins:

Ensure Jenkins is set up with the necessary plugins for Docker and Kubernetes.
Add your Docker and Kubernetes credentials to Jenkins.
Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and point it to this repository.
Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline is defined in the Jenkinsfile. It performs the following steps:

Checkout: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
Build: Builds the Docker image.
Push: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
Deploy: Applies the Kubernetes configurations to deploy the application.
Rollout Deployment: Restarts the deployment to apply the latest changes.
Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus: Collects metrics from Jenkins and Kubernetes.
Grafana: Visualizes the metrics for real-time monitoring and alerting.
Usage
Access the web application via the configured ingress URL.
Monitor the application and infrastructure using Grafana dashboards.
